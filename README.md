# Salary Prediction: Machine Learning Project
This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's annual salary exceeds $100,000 based on various features. By leveraging machine learning models, we aim to classify salaries into two categories—above and below $100K—while exploring the importance of feature engineering, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to predict salary categories using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various demographic and job-related features, and the analysis covers the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation. This project provides insights into:

1-Effective data preprocessing and feature engineering.

2-Training and comparing different classification models.

3-Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.


# Project Structure
This project begins with loading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure, followed by adding a new column that categorizes salaries into two groups: above and below $100K. The data is then preprocessed by encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and handling any missing values to prepare it for modeling. In the exploratory data analysis phase, key relationships between features and salary categories are visualized, with detailed analysis of correlations and feature distributions to derive meaningful insights. Multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, are trained on the data. To ensure robustness, cross-validation is employed for hyperparameter tuning. Model evaluation is performed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, supported by visualizations like confusion matrices and ROC-AUC curves. The results highlight the best-performing model and provide insights into feature importance and the effectiveness of preprocessing steps.

# Results
The analysis demonstrates that machine learning models can effectively predict whether an individual’s annual salary exceeds $100,000 based on the provided features. Among the models tested, the best-performing algorithm achieved high accuracy, balancing precision and recall to ensure reliable predictions for both salary categories. Feature engineering and data preprocessing proved to be critical in enhancing model performance, particularly by improving the representation of categorical variables and standardizing numerical features. The results are supported by visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC-AUC curves, which highlight the robustness of the models and their ability to generalize well to unseen data.
